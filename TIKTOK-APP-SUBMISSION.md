## App Description

TrendWatcher is an AI-powered trend detection service for e-commerce sellers. We identify emerging products 48 hours before they hit mainstream ad-spy tools.

## How We Use TikTok API

1. **TikTok Research API** - We monitor public hashtag data (#TikTokMadeMeBuyIt) to detect products with rapidly growing engagement metrics. This helps sellers identify winning products early.

2. **Product/Scope Usage:**
   - `research.trend.basic` - Access aggregated trend data to identify viral products
   - `video.list` - View publicly available video metrics to calculate velocity scores
   - `video.info` - Analyze video performance data to determine trending status

## User Benefit

Sellers receive a daily "Intelligence Card" showing trending products, velocity scores, and saturation metrics. This gives them a 48-hour first-mover advantage.

## Data Handling

- We only access publicly available hashtag data
- We do not store or share personal user information
- All analysis is aggregated and anonymous
- Users subscribe via our website (Stripe payment)
